fcitx-tablet
============

Entry of characters via an input tablet, integrated into the [fcitx](https://github.com/fcitx/fcitx/) input method framework. Your strokes are drawn on screen as you write.

fcitx-tablet should be easily extensible for different tablet drivers. Currently it supports some tablets based on a common chip from Gotop, see the [wiki page on hardware support](wiki/Hardware-Support) for details.

fcitx-tablet is easily extensible for different handwriting recognition engines. Currently it supports [zinnia](http://zinnia.sourceforge.net/) and forking to an external (potentially proprietary) recognition engine.
